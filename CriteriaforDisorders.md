###Feeding and Eating Disorders
<details>
<summary>View:</summary>
####Binge Eating Disorder
 1. Recurent episodes of binge eating
 2. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three or more of the following:  
 	1. eating more rapidly
 	2. feeling uncomfortably full
 	3. eating large amounts when not hungry
 	4. eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating
 	5. feeling disgusted or very guilty after binge eating
 3. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present
 4. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months
 - Note: The binge eating is not associated with compensatory behavior

####Bulimia Nervosa
 1. Recurrent episodes of binge eating
 2. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics
 3. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months
 4. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight
 5. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa
 - Unlike patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimic patients are typically of normal weight or slightly overweight

####Anorexia Nervosa
 1. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory and physical health.  Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
 2. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with wweight gain, eventhough at a significantly low weight.
 3. Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced , undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, ore persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.
 - Two types of Anorexia Nervosa:
 	1. Restricting Type-Dieting, Fasting and/or Exercise
 	2. Binge-Eating/Purging Type-Vomiting, Laxatives, Diuretics, Enemas

####Pica
 1. Persistent eating of non-nutritive substances for a period of at least one month.
 2. The eating of non-nutritive substances is inappropriate to the developmental level of the individual.
 3. The eating behaviour is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice.
 4. If occurring in the presence of another mental disorder (e.g. autistic spectrum  disorder), or during a medical condition (e.g. pregnancy), it is severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.

####Rumination Disorder
 1. Repeated regurgitation of food for a period of at least one month Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out.
 2. The repeated regurgitation is not due to a medication condition (e.g. gastrointestinal condition).
 3. The behaviour does not occur exclusively in the course of Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, BED, or Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake disorder.
 4. If occurring in the presence of another mental disorder (e.g. intellectual developmental disorder), it is severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.

<details>
<summary>Less Important Disorders:</summary>
####Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder
 - An Eating or Feeding disturbance as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following:
 	1. Significant loss of weight (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children).
 	2. Significant nutritional deficiency
 	3. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements
 	4. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning
 - The behavior is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice.
 - The behavior does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way one’s body weight or shape is experienced.
 - The eating disturbance is not attributed to a medical condition, or better explained by another mental health disorder. When is does occur in the presence of another condition/disorder, the behavior exceeds what is usually associated, and warrants additional clinical attention.

####Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder
 - According to the DSM-5 criteria, to be diagnosed as having OSFED a person must present with a feeding or eating behaviours that cause clinically significant distress and impairment in areas of functioning, but do not meet the full criteria for any of the other feeding and eating disorders.
 - A diagnosis might then be allocated that specifies a specific reason why the presentation does not meet the specifics of another disorder (e.g. Bulimia Nervosa- low frequency). The following are further examples for OSFED:
	- Atypical Anorexia Nervosa: All criteria are met, except despite significant weight loss, the individual’s weight is within or above the normal range
 	- Binge Eating Disorder (of low frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for BED are met, except at a lower frequency and/or for less than three months.
 	- Bulimia Nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for Bulimia Nervosa are met, except that the binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviour occurs at a lower frequency and/or for less than three months.
 	- Purging Disorder: Recurrent purging behaviour to influence weight or shape in the absence of binge eating
 	- Night Eating Syndrome: Recurrent episodes of night eating. Eating after awakening from sleep, or by excessive food consumption after the evening meal. The behavior is not better explained by environmental influences or social norms. The behavior causes significant distress/impairment. The behavior is not better explained by another mental health disorder (e.g. BED).

####Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder
 - According to the DSM-5 criteria this category applies to where behaviours cause clinically significant distress/impairment of functioning, but do not meet the full criteria of any of the Feeding or Eating Disorder criteria. This category may be used by clinicians where a clinician chooses not to specify why criteria are not met, including presentations where there may be insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g. in emergency room settings).

###Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders
<details>
<summary>View:</summary>
####Schizophrenia
- Two or more of the following symptoms, present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (less if successfully treated).  At least one must be 1, 2 or 3.
	1. Delusions
	2. Hallucinations
	3. Disorganized Speech (e.g. derailment or incoherence)
	4. Grossly Disorganized or Catatonic Behavior
	5. Negative Symptoms (diminished emotional expression or avolition)
- Dysfunction in work, interpersonal relations, or self-care.
- Signs of disturbance for at least 6 months, with at least 1 month of symptoms listed above
- Rule out Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive or Bipolar Disorder
- Symptoms not due to Physiological Effect of a Substance or Medical Condition
- Conditions for Autism Spectrum or Communication Disorder, must have delusions or hallucinations for at least 1 month

####Schizoaffective Disorder
1. An uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major mood episode (major depressive or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia.
	- Note: The major depressive episode must include Criterion A1: Depressed mood.
2. Delusions or hallucinations for 2 or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode (depressive or manic) during the lifetime duration of the illness.
3. Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness.
4. The disturbance is not attributable to the effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

####Schizophreniform Disorder
1. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):
	1. Delusions.
	2. Hallucinations.
	3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
	4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
	5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition).
2. An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than 6 months. When the diagnosis must be made without waiting for recovery, it should be qualified as “provisional.”
3. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either
	1. no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 
	2. if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
4. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

####Delusional Disorder
1. The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or longer.
2. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met.
	- Note: Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of infestation).
3. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.
4. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.
5. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder

####Brief Psychotic Disorder
1. Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):
	1. Delusions.
	2. Hallucinations.
	3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
	4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
		- Note: Do not include a symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned response.
2. Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning. 
3. The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or another psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or catatonia, and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

###Mood Disorders
<details>
<summary>View:</summary>
<details>
<summary>__Major Depressive Disorder__</summary>

- Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present
during the same 2-week period and represent a change from
previous functioning; 
	- at least one of the symptoms is either
		1. depressed mood or
		2. loss of interest or pleasure.
	- Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.
	1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
	2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
	3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
	4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
	5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
	6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
	7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
	8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
	9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
- The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.
	- Note: Criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.
	- Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode.
- Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.
- The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.
- There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.
- Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

</details>

<details>
<summary>__Manic Episode__</summary>

- A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
- During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:
	1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.
	2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).
	3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
	4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.
	5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
	6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).
	7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).
- The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.
- The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.
- Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.

</details>

<details>
<summary>__Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)__</summary>

- This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined
chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.
- Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated by either subjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years. 
	- Note: In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at least 1 year.
- Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following:
	1. Poor appetite or overeating.
	2. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
	3. Low energy or fatigue.
	4. Low self-esteem.
	5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.
	6. Feelings of hopelessness.
- During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the individual has never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a time.
- Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present for 2 years.
- There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode, and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder.
- The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
- The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism).
- The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- Note: Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include four symptoms that are absent from the symptom list for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very limited number of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer than 2 years but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met at some point during the current episode of illness, they should be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Otherwise, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder is warranted.
